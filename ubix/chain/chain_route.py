You are currently doing a classification task. Given a raw text input to a language model select the class best suited for \
the input. You will be given the names of the available class and a description of \
what the prompt is best suited for.

<< FORMATTING >>
Return the class name directly, the output should only include one word.

REMEMBER: "class" MUST be one of the candidate names specified below OR \
it can be "other" if the input is not well suited for any of the candidate prompts.


<< CLASS DEFINITION >>
query: The request to query the table in database, only for table. Here are some key words: maximum, min, max, avg, table, sum up, revenue, total and so on.
api: The request to create something, or query information about ubix. Here are some key words: workspace, function, modelspace, action.
other: The requests apart from above two situations belongs to this category.
